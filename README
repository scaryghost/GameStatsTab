About:
The mutator will add a "Game Stats" tab to the mid game menu that will 
display detailed statistics about your actions in the current game.  There 
are sliders at the bottom of the table that allow you to configure the 
background and text colors, the transparency of the panel, and the text 
size.  Initially, the panel will be all black but the settings you pick 
will stick.

For more information about the mutator, please visit the mutator wiki given 
in the below link.

Special Thanks:
Marco       The stats box from ServerPerks was crucial in helping me 
            understand how to set up my own stats
